**Benchmarking Traditional vs AI-Driven Intrusion Detection System for OWASP Threats **
The capstone project "Benchmarking Traditional vs. AI-Driven IDS for OWASP Threats" aims to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional IDS against AI-driven IDS in detecting and mitigating the OWASP Threats.

Benchmarking Traditional vs. AI-Driven IDS for OWASP threats, this study explores the effectiveness of both traditional and AI-driven IDS against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. By leveraging real-world attack datasets, it benchmarks Snort against machine learning and deep learning models. This Capstone aims to achieve the following Objectives.
Objective 1: Build and configure a Traditional IDS (Snort) to detect OWASP Top 10 web application vulnerabilities.
Objective 2: Identify, Collect and prepare labelled datasets suitable for training and testing AI models, ensuring they cover a variety of OWASP-related attack scenarios.
Objective 3: Build AI-driven IDS models using machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
Objective 4: Evaluate and compare the detection performance of traditional IDS (Snort) and AI-driven IDS models in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rates, and response times, identifying strengths and limitations for practical deployment.
This chapter establishes a clear framework for benchmarking traditional and AI-driven IDS against OWASP threats using real-world data. The outlined objectives lay the foundation for a practical comparison of detection capabilities, guiding the study toward actionable insights.
